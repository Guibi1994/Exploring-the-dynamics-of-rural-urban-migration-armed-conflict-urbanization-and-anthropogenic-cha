Abstract:
Anthropogenic change is generally associated with population growth, land use change, and changing economies. However, 
internal migration patterns and armed conflicts are also key drivers of anthropogenic and demographic processes. To better understand 
the processes associated with this change, we explore the spatial relationship between forced migration due to armed conflict and 
changing socioeconomic factors in Colombia, a country which has a recent history of  7 million internal migrants. In addition, we use 
remote sensing, Google Earth Engine, as well as spatial statistical analyses of demographic data in order to measure anthropogenic 
change between 1984 and 2008 - a socio-politically important period in Colombia’s armed conflict. We also analyze spatiotemporal 
relationships between socioeconomic and anthropogenic changes, which are caused by forced migration. We found that forced migration is
significantly and positively related to an increasing rural-urban type of migration which results from armed conflict. Results also 
show that it is negatively related to interregional displacement. Indeed, anthropogenic footprints pertaining to different regions have
had different sensitivities towards forced migration, and across different time periods. Finally, we discuss how socioeconomic and 
political phenomena such as armed conflict can have complex effects on the dynamics of anthropogenic and ecological change as well as 
movement of humans in countries like Colombia.
